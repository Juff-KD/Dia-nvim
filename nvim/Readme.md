# Dia-Nvim :smiley:
>
    - This Dia-Nvim is my very first config using plugins from awesome contributors of Neovim community.
    - I learned for config neovim in Windows from preconfigs, especially ADICs, Kickstart and a lot more.
    - And I still don't have an idea how to setup in my nvim config though.
    - You can check keymaps and edit as you want.
    - I already set five cool colorschemes.

## I am using in Windows, that's why I installed `Language server windows x64` for `Codeium`.

- I did this setup as I desire. And finally..
**Thaks to all..** :blush:
