# Dia-Nvim :smiley:
>
    - This Dia-Nvim is my very first config using plugins from awesome contributors of Neovim community.
    - I learned for config neovim in Windows from preconfigs, especially ADICs, Kickstart and a lot more.
    - And I still don't have an idea how to setup in my nvim config though.
    - I did this setup as I desire. And finally.. :blush:

**Thaks to all.**
